                <p>To help to spread the word about our community broadband project new posters have been put on the Village Hall A-boards. We hope that the posters will encourage members of our community to find out about our project. We also hope that people who already know about our project will use the posters to start conversations about gigabit broadband and our B4RN project.</p>
                <p>Let us know what you think about the posters.</p></div>

                <p><b>Vouchers</b> – We are continuing to canvass using phone calls, email and social media. As well as the volunteer canvassers we have asked all those that have applied for a voucher to help by encouraging their friends and neighbours to apply for Gigabit Vouchers.</p>

                <p><b>Investment</b> – We now have a group of more than 160 members of the community that have applied for vouchers and we have now contacted this group about investing. We are continuing to use social media and newsletters to encourage more investment.</p>
                    
                <p><b>Wayleaves</b> – The document that formalises the agreement with a landowner giving permission to lay ducting on their land is called a Wayleave. Wayleaves (which will help to keep the project costs down) are with four principal landowners, particularly on core routes around Mollington parish. Our focus at the moment is to make sure that we have all the wayleaves we need to install the ducting from the Cheshire B4RN project in Capenhurst to the Primary School in Mollington.</p>
                <p>A meeting is being arranged for landowners at which they can discuss any issues they have with a representative from B4RN.</p>
